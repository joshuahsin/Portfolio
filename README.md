# Bio
Hello, welcome to my Github Portfolio! My name is Joshua and I am a Computer Science Graduate from UC Irvine currently residing in Denver, CO. I have been working as a software engineer in various projects from 2023 to now at LTIMindtree, an IT Consulting company. Some of these projects include working with Paramount and BPX Energy. For example, at Paramount, I worked as a Python Backend Engineer on a media configuration application as a part of a workflow that delivered media to different parts of the world. 

My main skills are in Python Django and Java Spring Boot App Development. I also have experience with frontend frameworks React and Angular, as well as various SQL and NoSQL databases including MySQL, PostGreSQL, Snowflake and MongoDB. Additionally, I have worked with many AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, S3, etc.

# Projects
## Weather App (Java Spring Boot, React, Node, MySQL, Cursor AI, Gooogle Gemini API, Openweather API, Geoapify API, HTML, CSS)
In this personal project, I created a Weather App that provides basic functions such as providing wether and forecast details for the user's current location and allow user's to search for cities, as well as edit a saved list of cities for easy access. However, I also utilizied Google Gemini's API to harness the power of Generative AI and give attraction recommendations to th user near the current location accounting for daily weather. User's can either create and save or export their own itinerary chosen from recommended attractions or fully rely on Generative AI to generative a detailed itinerary appropriate to daily weather, including pricing details and general tips, and emergency contacts. To help produce base code in my NodeJS Backend and React Frontend, format HTML and CSS elements, and generally improve code quality, I employed the user of Cursor AI, an AI powered code editor which helps with code generation and auto-completion.

## Food Delivery App (Java Spring Boot, Angular, MySQL, Spring JPA, Spring Hibernate, Spring Eureka, Mockito, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, TypeScript)
During my training at LTIMindtree, I helped develop Food Delivery App from scratch in a team of 5. This App also included different user specific actions and pages sorted by user type - User, Vendor, and Admin. Users are able to add foods and eligable coupons to their order. Vendors can edit their offers, food items, and other elements on their store page. The Admin can add or remove vendors and provide or delete widely available offers.

## Movie Rental App - (Java Spring Boot, MySQL, React, React Native, HTML, Boostrap, CSS, Spring JDBC, JSX, Jackson)
As a personal project, I created a Movie Rental Application in which users could log in, sign up, post feedback about movies, view movie details, filter movie searches by various field, check out movies etc.

## Inverted Index Search Engine (Python, BeautifulSoup)
In this project, I created a search engine which used a parser through xml files to analyze web pages and sort them by relevance, mapping words to a list of web pages sorted by relevance. I used different strategies to determine relevance, such as including page rank (how many relevant web pages link to a web page), removing stop words, and treating cases such as acronyms.

## Silent Auction (C)
In this project, I used mutlithreading to create an appllication running in terminal with a real time counter for auctioning different items. The user is able to log in, put up items for auction, bid on items, watch/track auctions, and see which items they own. This application was made with client server architecture where the server communites with the user.

## Stock Market Strategizer (Python)
In this project, I used historical stock data from a public API and implmented an interface where users can use different stock strategies and historical stock price data in order to generate buy and sell signals for future days.

## Machine Learning Data Classifier (Python, Jyputer Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, mltools, sklearn)
In this project, I collaborated in a group of 5 to train different machine learning methods on 7500 training points of data with 107 features. We employed the top machine learning methods in an ensemble, experimenting with different weights to achieve ~74% testing accuracy on an additional 7500 testing points of data.

## Self Balancing AVL Tree (C++)
in this project, I implemented a self balancing AVL Tree which takes comparable types as input and balances as needed when new node inputs are placed in the tree.
