# Bio
Hello, welcome to my Github Portfolio! My name is Joshua and I am a Computer Science Graduate from UC Irvine currently residing in Long Beach, CA. I have been working for the last year at LTIMindtree, an IT Consulting company. At my previous project at LTIMindtree, I worked with Paramount on a workflow that delivered media to different parts of the world. 

My main skills are in Python Django and Java Spring Boot App Development. I also have expereince with frontend frameworks React and Angular, as well as databases incluing MySQL, PostGreSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have worked with many AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, etc.

# Projects
## Food Delivery App (Java Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, Eureka, Mockito, MySQL, Angular, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS)
During my training at LTIMindtree, I created a Food Delivery App from scratch in a team of 5, complete with different pages such as log in, sign up, cart, complete order pages, etc. This App also included different user specific actions and pages sorted by user type - User, Vendor, and Admin. 

## Movie Rental App - (Java Spring Boot, JDBC, MySQL, React, React Native, HTML, Boostrap, CSS, JSX, Jackson)
As a personal project, I created a Movie Rental Application in which users could log in, sign up, post feedback about movies, view movie details, filter movie searches by various field, etc.

## Inverted Index Search Engine (Python, BeautifulSoup)
In this project, I created a search engine which used a parser through xml files to analyze web pages and sort them by relevance, mapping words to a list of web pages sorted by relevance. I used different strategies to determine relevance, such as including page rank (how many relevant web pages link to a web page), removing stop words, and treating cases such as acronyms.

## Silent Auction (C)
In this project, I used mutlithreading to create an appllication running in terminal with a real time counter for auctioning different items. The user is able to log in, put up items for auction, bid on items, watch/track auctions, and see which items they own. This application was made with client server architecture where the server communites with the user.

## Stock Market Strategizer (Python)
In this project, I used historical stock data from a public API and implmented an interface where users can use different stock strategies and historical stock price data in order to generate buy and sell signals for future days.

## Machine Learning Data Classifier (Python, Jyputer Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, mltools, sklearn)
In this project, I collaborated in a group of 5 to train different machine learning methods on 7500 training points of data with 107 features. We employed the top machine learning methods in an ensemble, experimenting with different weights to achieve ~74% testing accuracy on an additional 7500 testing points of data.

## Self Balancing AVL Tree (C++)
in this project, I implemented a self balancing AVL Tree which takes comparable types as input and balances as needed when new node inputs are placed in the tree.
