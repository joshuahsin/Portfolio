# Bio
Hello, welcome to my Github Portfolio! My name is Joshua and I am a Computer Science Graduate from UC Irvine currently residing in Long Beach, CA. I have been working for the last year at LTIMindtree, an IT Consulting company. At my previous project at LTIMindtree, I worked with Paramount on a workflow that delivered media to different parts of the world. 

My main skills are in Python Django and Java Spring Boot App Development. I also have expereince with frontend frameworks React and Angular, as well as databases incluing MySQL, PostGreSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have worked with many AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, etc.

# Projects
## Food Delivery App
During my training at LTIMindtree, I created a Food Delivery App from scratch in a team of 5, complete with different pages such as log in, sign up, cart, complete order pages, etc. This App also included different user specific actions and pages sorted by user type - User, Vendor, and Admin. 

In the backend, we used a combination of Spring JPA, Hibernate, and Eureka. In the frontend, we used Angular to construct our UI. Finally, in the backend, we used MySQL as our database.

## Movie Rental App
As a personal project, I created a Movie Rental Application in which users could log in, sign up, post feedback about movies, view movie details, filter movie searches by various field, etc.

For this project, I used a combination of Java Springboot and Spring JDBC in the backend, ReactJS, Bootstrap, CSS and JSX in the backend, and a MySQL database.

## Inverted Index Search Engine
In this project, I created a search engine which used a parser through xml files to analyze web pages and sort them by relevance, mapping words to a list of web pages sorted by relevance. I used different strategies to determine relevance, such as including page rank (how many relevant web pages link to a web page), removing stop words, and treating cases such as acronyms.
